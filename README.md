# ArgoCD Project on KinD with NGINX Deployment via Helm

This repository demonstrates how to set up an ArgoCD-based GitOps workflow on a KinD (Kubernetes in Docker) cluster, using NGINX as a sample application deployed via a Helm chart.
The project is structured to support multiple environments, such as `dev` and `prod`, with centralized management of configurations and secrets.
